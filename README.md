Communication is a mean for people to exchange messages. It has started since the
beginning of human creation. Distant communication began as early as 1800 century
with the introduction of television, telegraph and then telephony. Interestingly enough,
telephone communication stands out as the fastest growing technology, from XED line
to mobile wireless, from voice call to data transfer. The emergence of computer network
and telecommunication technologies bears the same objective that is to allow people to
communicate. All this while, much efforts has been drawn towards consolidating the
device into one and therefore indiscriminate the services. Chatting is a method of using
technology to bring people and ideas together despite of the geographical barriers. The
technology has been available for years but the acceptance it was quit recent. Our
project is an example of a chat server. It is made up of applications the client application
which runs on the users mobile and server application which runs on any pc on the
network. To start chatting our client should get connected to server where they can do
Group and private chatting.
